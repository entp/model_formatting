This is a plugin for Rails that performs automatic text-to-html formatting. 

For rails 2.3, please use the 'rails23' branch (you can specify ~> 0.2 in your gemfile)

It uses the 'redcarpet' markdown library with a few other pre-processing steps.
Note: tests do not run on 1.9.x series due to a bug in the test frameworks we use,
but the code works fine.

It is extracted from and used by [Tender](http://tenderapp.com/) and [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/).
